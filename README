Overview
========

OpenDNP3 is a portable, scalable, and rigorously tested implementation
of the DNP3 (www.dnp.org) protocol stack written in C++. The library is
optimized for the largest front end processor implementations and slave
device simulations, although it performs very well on embedded linux ARM
in a single outstation configuration.

Custom written, idiomatic bindings are available for the Microsoft CLR
family of languages (C#, VB.NET, F#, etc) and JVM-based languages (Java,
Scala, Clojure, etc).

About AGPLv3
============

AGPLv3 is a copyleft license that triggers even if you are only using
the library against a 3rd party over a network. You must either abide by
the terms of the license or purchase a proprietary friendly license.
