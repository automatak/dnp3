IDataObserver is the key interface between master/outstation and
the "application" code. The outstation application is responsible for measuring or
calculating data and then pushing it into this interface when it is ready
to publish it. The master application is responsible for handling the data
as it is received from an outstation. That data needs to be strongly typed
and passed by index. As with all ITransactables it should be used with the
exception safe Transaction object.

	Transaction t(pObserver);
