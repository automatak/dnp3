	The event buffer doesn't actually own the buffers, it just creates
    collection facades around the indexable buffers it's given.
	This is done so that the buffers can either be statically or dynamically allocated.

	The sequence of events list in the facade is a doubly linked-list implemented
	in a finite array.  The list is desired for O(1) remove operations from
	arbitrary parts of the list depending on what the user asks for in terms
	of event type or Class1/2/3.

	At worst, selection is O(n) in the SOE length but it has some type/class
	tracking to avoid looping over the SOE list when there are no more events matching
	the selection criteria.
